# Backend Technical Challenge
This project is designed to demonstrate core backend development skills, focusing on creating and managing APIs, containerization, database management, and CI/CD pipelines. The primary technologies used are Python, Go, PostgreSQL and RestFramework.

# The key focus was to:
1. Create a simple Python or Go service
2. Design a simple customers and orders database (keep it simple)
3. Add a REST or GraphQL API to input / upload customers and orders:
- Customers have simple details e.g., name and code.
- Orders have simple details e.g., item, amount, and time.
4. Implement authentication and authorization via OpenID Connect
5. When an order is added, send the customer an SMS alerting them (you can use the
Africaâ€™s Talking SMS gateway and sandbox)
6. Write unit tests (with coverage checking) and set up CI + automated CD. You can deploy
to any PAAS/FAAS/IAAS of your choice
7. Write a README for the project and host it on your GitHub
